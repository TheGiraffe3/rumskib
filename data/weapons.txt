	description "In the early part of the space era, the settlements in the region of space known as the Deep developed in relative isolation from the rest of human space. One result of that isolation is that their weapons technology mostly uses beam weapons, instead of the energy projectile weapons that are more common elsewhere."
	description "	The Quadruple Beam Laser is a modified version of the regular Beam Laser. The designers took the opportunity to make it slightly more precise and decreased the heat per second for each individual laser, but as four packed together it is still much hotter than a normal laser."

	description "Unlike the Laser Turret, the quadified version does not turn fast enough to hold off fighter pilots. However, the nearly doubled damage output more than makes up for this slight disadvantage."
	description "	Although it would make more sense to mount a Quad Beam Laser on a turret, Deep Sky instead decided to double the lasers held by the normal laser turret as a cheaper way to increase the damage output."

	description "The Plasma Turret is a pair of Plasma Cannons mounted on a turret so that they can fire in any direction. It is a fearsome weapon, but only the largest of ships have the space and the energy that it requires."
	description "	The Quad Plasma Turret is even more powerful then the Plasma Turret, but its size makes it entirely impractical - it costs more than a fleet of small ships and would occupy the entirety of a ship's weapon space. As such, no independent captain will use it."

	description `In an act that would make Dr. Richard J. Gatling spin in his grave with the ferocity of the barrels of his invention, the Gatling Turret was born when a resourceful pirate thought to replace the Energy Blasters on a Blaster Turret with a pair of Gatling Guns. Ever since, the dominion of the Gatling Turret has spread across the Southern Rim, terrorizing merchants and law enforcement alike with its unparalleled ability to tear apart the hulls of ships.`
	description `	The Single Gatling Turret came into existence when a pirate decided that the space requirements for the Blaster Turret were too high and dismounted one of the Gatling guns, making an unbalanced weapon that slows ships down but turns even faster then a normal turret. As a result, this turret is the best anti-fighter weapon employed by pirates, mainly against the Navy.`

	description "While swords are seen today as being old curios and commemorative objects, rendered useless when gunpowder became dominant on the battlefield thousands of years ago, this sword is unlike any you have seen before. Despite how heavy it looks, it is remarkably light, and there are inscriptions on the blade itself that don't appear to be like any human language."
	description "	For whatever reason, the red beam within the blade seems to pulsate as you swing it; perhaps there is more to the sword than you know."
